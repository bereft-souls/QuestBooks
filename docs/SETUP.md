# QuestBooks API Setup

## Adding QuestBooks to Your Mod

Before you can start working with QuestBooks, you first need to add it as either a mod dependency or weak reference to your mod.
  
First, head on over to the QuestBooks releases tab, find the latest release, and download `QuestBooks.dll`.
  
Next, in your mod's source folder, add a folder titled 'lib/', and place 'QuestBooks.dll' into this folder.

Finally, in your mod's `build.txt` add either `modReferences = QuestBooks`, or `weakReferences = QuestBooks`. The former will add QuestBooks as a hard dependency, whereas the second will add it as a soft reference.

Now you're ready to begin adding your own quest lines!
